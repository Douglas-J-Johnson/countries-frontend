This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Countries

Countries in an app that lets you visually explore data about the countries of our world.

## Installation

Fork and clone this project.  In the project directory run `npm install` to set up required node packages.  Then rune `npm start` to start up the application server on default port 3000.  If you need additional information on NPM itself, reference the [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

## Usage

The application functionality is broken down into two main functions.  The initial page displayed shows a set of sortable and filterable cards for all of the countries of the world.  By clicking on the database item at the top of the page, you are able to access the map portion of the application where you can display color coded country data on a world map.  Clicking on the map icon at the top of the page will return you to the country card list.
